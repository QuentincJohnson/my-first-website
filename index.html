            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>I was born in the states (santa monica spicifically) but moved to canada when I was around 3 mounths old, other than once to visit I havent left canada sincee. we did this because I required heart surgery and rather than paying for mediocrity in the states, scince my mom was a canadian citizen, we moved over and I was treated by amazing doctors at sick kids. If you cant tell by now my spelling is atrocious so bear with me (send help). some extra stuff to know is that I suffer from OCD/axiety wich can be hard to deal with at times wich is somthing I feel I should let you know as my proffesor. I live at home with my mom and love to frequent <strong>Super Smash bros Ultimate </strong> tournaments. </p>

                    <p class="intrests-p para-left" >Music is somthing that has been a part of my life for a long time. When I was little I learned how to play the piano. that eventuelly came to my benifit when I started to produce music digitally. I use FL studio to produce music, I like to make instramentals spicifically electronic and rap. On top of all that, Like any person I like to listen to music. I dont listen to one gennera spicifically but generally alot of the songs I like are either rock-ish rap-ish or electronic-ish.  </p>

                <p class="intrests-p para-right">I have almost always loved video games. I grew up playing on my dads Ps2, unfortunatly regardless of rating I played it, the first few games I plyed were god of war and grand theft auto:san andreas. when I got my fist console which was a gamecube I became especually fond of Sonic the Hedgehog, I played almost all the Sonic games growing up. in middle school I was bordrline addicted to playing Xbox online with my friends. Call of Duty: Black ops 2 holds a speciall place in my heart. I have so many memories of me playing. </p>

            <img class="joker" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/avatar_a70cf907eaa3_128.gif" alt="persona">
            <p class="special-p">All though a video game this, deserves its own section for several reasons. firstly I would like to say I am a hue fan of Nintendo. That being said, Super samsh Bros is a collaberation of all things nintendo, but not only that it is a collaberation of ALL video games. For this reason I hold this as one of my favorite games. I compete competitivly in super smash brothers. To do this I go to tournements. when I play competitivly I play a charecter called <a href="https://youtu.be/bMC2t1fCUtg?t=55" target="_blank">joker</a> from a game called persona 5. Persona 5 is one of my favorite games and the fact that a charecter from it made an aperance in smash brothers makes me unbelievably happy. I have met a some really cool people at these tournements and made some good friends. The charecters I least like to play against are cloud, and pokemon trainer nonetheless, although at a small tournement my best placement is 2nd. Another reason smash is special to me is because I love commentating over matches. I commentat the tournement games that are streamed on twitch. I like to joke around and interact with people watching as well as I get to learn more about the game by watching it while also enjoying myself and helping the streams viewers out by providing commentary. </p>
